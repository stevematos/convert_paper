It is important to note that the Borderline Loss predictions
are not included in the computation of Accuracy, whereas they
are included in the computation of the other scores above. We
could describe the True Positive Rate and related scores as
pessimistic, as they will consider as incorrect any predictions
that fall into the borderline loss zone, whereas the Accuracy
measure is optimistic as it ignores predictions in that zone. For
this reason, it is advisable to consider all of these scores
together to get a clear picture of classifiers’ performance.

The percentage of opportunities that were classified in the
Borderline Loss category for each algorithm was observed. The
existing QSP model classifies 26.69% of opportunities in this
category for the dataset obseved, while the TAN classifier and
Naïve Bayes classifier categorise 7.83% and 6.65% in the
Borderline Loss category, respectively. The most ideal
prediction algorithm would predict few or no opportunities in
this category.
A comparison of all three predictor models is shown in
Table 6.
B. ROC Curves
ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves are used to
examine and compare the predictive performance of the
classifiers. It plots the true positive rate of a classifier against
its false positive rate (or 1 – TNR). The graphical plot measures
classifier performance by calculating the area under the curve
(AUC). A perfect classifier would have a curve which reaches
the most upper left corner of the graph with a true positive rate

C. Discussion of Results
From these results, it is observed that Bayesian classifiers
show a significant improvement on the existing QSP used by
HP. More specifically, the TAN classifier proved to be the
most accurate of all the models evaluated.
As a result of these accuracies, it was decided to use the TAN
model for the sales forecasting model and to drive a future
alert system application. A comparison of the TAN models
predictions and existing QSP predictions side by side was
observed and analysed. The predictions were also analysed
when filtered by attributes such as Region, Sub Region, Deal
Type and Contract Value Range and predictive accuracy of the
TAN model remained high in comparison to the QSP.
For the validation dataset, the TAN classifier predicted
differently to the existing QSP in 43.8% of instances. These
are examples of when the alert system would highlight the
opportunities to the sales teams and the TAN classifier
predicted correctly for 87.75% of these.
V. CONCLUSION

Analytics provide the fuel for an organization to make
better decisions faster. The primary focus of this paper is
development of a more accurate forecasting model that can be
used to implement a sales forecasting alert system in HP. In
this paper, we propose an improved method of predicting sales
opportunities’ outcomes using machine learning methods.
Of the algorithms evaluated, Bayesian classifiers were
found to be the most useful and suitable learning algorithms for
the application and data. More specifically, the TAN classifier

had the highest predictive accuracy in testing and validation.
The final approach yielded 90.6% accuracy, indicating that the
TAN algorithm significantly improved upon the QSP, which
had an accuracy of 75.6% on the same test data. The TAN
model will be used to develop an alerting system for the sales
team for improved decision making for open pipeline
opportunities and to identify the main ‘risk factor’ for
individual opportunities.
It is interesting to note that, given the extremely high
performance delivered by our Bayesian classifiers, it can be
concluded that the answers of the sales team are valuable and
of high quality, despite the risk of errors when depending on
sales peoples’ judgement identified by Rotenberg et al., as was
discussed in Section II.
Future work for the forecasting model will include a more
complex analysis of attribute influence on classification and
optimisation of feature selection.
