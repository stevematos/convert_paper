Abstract — Many businesses rely on forecasting techniques to
detect whether sales opportunities are likely to be won or at risk
of being lost. This enables the businesses to respond proactively.
This paper describes a new method of sales forecasting that
improves on an existing Qualitative Sales Predictor (QSP) in
Hewlett-Packard (HP). QSP is based on a series of qualitative
assessments that are made by sales personnel, the results of which
are combined using weighted factors. In this research, we have
developed an alternative method of forecasting sales
opportunities, with three key differences: (1) the qualitative
assessments are supplemented with quantitative data describing
attributes of the opportunity; (2) we replace the weight factors
with a Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN) classifier that can
capture dependences between variables and produces a
probabilistic output to which thresholds can be applied; (3) the
TAN classifier is of course learned from historical data, whereas
the existing QSP has fixed weights. Our approach has an
accuracy of 90.6% in predicting whether sales will be won or lost,
a substantial improvement on the existing approach’s accuracy
of 75.6% on the same unseen test data.

I. INTRODUCTION

Big Data must be analysed to uncover meaningful, useful
and prompt insights. Data analytics allows for the identification
of new business opportunities, more efficient use of limited
resources and improved decision making in a timely and
actionable manner [11]. One key data analytics task is to
predict outcomes of future events, such as sales. Sales
forecasting involves identifying trends in historical data,
discovering relationships between sales attributes [6], and
estimating the likelihood of a sales opportunity to win or lose.
It is critical that key decision makers such as sales leaders have
access to sales data and accurate forecasts in a relevant way, so
they can take actions, make efficient decisions and react to
change as quickly as possible. An existing forecasting model,
which we refer to in this paper as Qualitative Sales Predictor
(QSP), has been evaluated in HP. As described in Section II.A,
it consists of a scoring system applied to qualitative data.
The research in this paper focuses on detecting deals at risk
of being lost or deals with potential to be won that may have
been incorrectly classified by QSP. We identify candidate
machine learning algorithms for this task, apply and evaluate
whether they deliver higher performance for the task of sales
forecasting. Specifically we consider Bayesian classifiers
because: (1) they can handle uncertainty in a principled

manner; (2) except for Naïve Bayes classifiers, they can handle
dependencies between variables, whereas the existing QSP
does not; (3) they output probabilities that can be further
interpreted; (4) they can be constructed by inductive learning
from historical data.
As well as using more sophisticated algorithms than those
used in QSP, we combine both quantitative and qualitative
sales attributes, to further improve performance. Discrepancies
between QSP’s predictions and our Bayesian classifier
predictions will provide insight and alerts to the sales team.
This in turn will drive a sales forecasting alert system to detect
deals at risk and deals with potential to win that have been
incorrectly classified. HP Enterprise Services have developed
a sales mobile app used globally by sales management and
executive level in the business. Our proposed Bayesian
classifier is being embedded in it, to drive deal-specific alerts.
This will guide the sales team to close more deals, increase
sales, identify deals at risk that may require an intervention,
accelerate the sales force productivity and overall result in a
more efficient sales pipeline.

II. RELATED WORK
A. Sales Forecasting Methods
Machine learning and statistics are widely used for sales
analytics and to determine significant factors for sales
forecasting. Some of the methods used in industries include
linear regression, neural networks and Bayesian networks [2].
Rotenberg et al. [13, 14] describe a multivariate regression
approach for sales forecasting used by Insight Squared and
identifies key influencing factors as opportunity value, sales
stage and the age of the opportunity. IBM’s Watson analytics
[7] uses logistic regression and scalable analytics and the user
can analyse the sales data with plain language queries.
However, these sales forecasting algorithms only use
quantitative data which could potentially exclude valuable
qualitative sales details. Qualitative forecasting is essential if
historical data is not available, but can supplement quantitative
data also. It can include informed opinion or judgment, market
research, or questionnaires that converge towards an accurate
answer.
HP’s QSP aims to provide a snapshot of how an
opportunity is positioned to win based on the sales team’s
opinion. The sales team assess an opportunity according to
many qualitative factors such as customer relationship,
competitive position and terms and conditions of an
opportunity. The sales team assign Green, Amber or Red to
each qualitative assessment and a weighting factor is applied to
these answers to produce a final predictor score. The scores are
categorised into Win, Borderline Loss and Loss. An advantage
of this model is that it is based on the salesperson’s opinion
which can measure factors which may not be possible to
quantify or calculate computationally. However, as noted by
Rotenberg et al. [14], a risk with qualitative-only forecasts is
that questions may not be answered accurately due to poor
judgement, over-optimism or intentional underestimation by
the salesperson. The ideal sales forecast should combine both
qualitative and quantitative data, learning from historical sales
data and use the most influential and significant sales factors.
B. Machine Learning
Machine learning is concerned with techniques and
algorithms for performing tasks that improve with experience
at performing specific tasks [11]. The main categories of
machine learning tasks are classification, regression,
clustering, co-training, relationship discovery, and
reinforcement learning. We approach the sales forecasting
problem of this paper as a probabilistic classification task, as
the goal is to estimate the likelihood of a sales opportunity
being won or lost. Popular classification algorithms include
linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers,
neural networks and decision trees [16]. For this paper, we will
focus on Bayesian classification algorithms, for the reasons
that were outlined in the Introduction.
Bayesian networks provide a probabilistic representation of
knowledge. A Bayesian network is composed of the network
structure (a directed acyclic graph with arcs representing
dependencies between variables, represented as nodes) and a
set of conditional probabilities associated with the arcs.
General Bayesian Networks (GBNs) and restricted network
structures such as Naïve Bayes and TAN (see below) may be
used in classification [10]. First, the network structure and its
probabilities are induced from the data. Then, it is assumed that
the value of the class node is unknown and the values of all
other nodes are known, and for every possible instantiation of
the class node, the joint probability of all variables in the
network is calculated. Equation (1) shows the conditional
probability calculation of a node Xi, given the values of all of
its parent nodes.
